If you're using a wireless controller, please make sure it is on before creating a mapping. Some controllers emit "Button Pressed/Released" signals when turning them on, which may lead to wrongly mapped keys.

.SH "PYTHON VERSION"

.TP
\fBreicast-joyconfig\fR is written in Python and needs the evdev module to work:
\fIhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/evdev\fP

.TP
Distributions like Ubuntu have the evdev module as a package in their repositories - in these cases you should use your package manager instead of pip to install it.

.TP
Although \fBreicast-joyconfig\fR does support both Python 2.6 or higher and 3.0 or higher, you need to run \fBreicast-joyconfig\fR with the same Python version that you installed the evdev module for, i.e. if you installed the evdev module for Python 2, you also need to run \fBreicast-joyconfig\fR using Python 2 and vice-versa.
