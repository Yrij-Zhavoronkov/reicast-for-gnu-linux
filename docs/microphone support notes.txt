plan:
-figure out the mic commands that seaman is looking for and implement them [DONE (a couple commands not supported)]
-create mic test app (consult bluecrab) [Otoire tunes should be great and the other real games that support mic - should compile list]
-figure out how the game/dc requests the audio (or how the mic just streams)... [Done - at least in seaman DC tells mic to start recording then polls the mic pretty frequently for data]
-for poc just create some kind of global way to pass the audio data from android mic interface directly to the maple_base instance [Done]
-test [Created recording in Otoire, imported VMS into Demul and got the sound! Seaman needs more testing]
-cleanup [Partially done, lots of logging left]
-test more
-integrate into settings ui
